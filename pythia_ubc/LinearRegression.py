# This script builds a Linear regression class to analyse data.
# It supports a continuous response and several continuous features.
# The class has a constructor building and fitting the model, and

        This function returns an instance of the LinearRegression class.
        Its attributes are the coefficients estimates, the fitted values 
        and the residuals from fitting a linear regression of y on X.
        
        Arguments:
          X: a dataframe containing continuous variables (including the response)
          y: a string, the name of the response variable
        
        Values: a LinearRegression object containing
          weights: the estimates of the parameters of the linear regression
          fitted: the fitted values
          residuals: the residuals.
